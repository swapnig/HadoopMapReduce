## Synopsis

Goal now is to compute the pattern of monthly delays for each airline.  

More precisely, for each airline, the program produces an output line like this:  

AIR-A, (1, A1), (2, A2),…, (11, A11), (12, A12)  
AIR-B, (1, B1), (2, B2),…, (11, B11), (12, B12)  
  
Here AIR-A stands for an airline name. Pair (i, Ai) indicates the average delay Ai of airline AIR-A in month i of the year 2008. For example, (6,17) means
that AIR-A had an average delay of 17 minutes in June 2008. All such pairs are sorted in increasing order of month.


## Description

**Secondary Sort** : Uses value-to-key conversion design pattern to partition by airlineId and sort by month.  
  
**KeyComparator (keypair)** : Object with 2 attributes airlineId and month  
  
**Hbase :**  

**H-POPULATE:** This program reads records from the input file and writes each record 1-to-1 to an HBase table. All records are stored in the same table. For input record r, there is exactly one matching row r’ in that table. Also for n records in input file, HBase table contains the corresponding n rows with all the fields from the n input records.  
  
**H-COMPUTE:** This program reads from the HBase table to generate the desired output file.   
  
**Value-to-key conversion design pattern:**  
– To partition by X and then sort each X-group by Y, make (X, Y) the key  
– Define key comparator to order by composite key (X, Y)  
– Define partitioner and grouping comparator for (X,Y) to consider only X for partitioning and grouping
