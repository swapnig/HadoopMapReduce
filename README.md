## Synopsis

Goal is	to learn Apache (big)database frameworks - Hadoop, Pig, Hive, Hbase

## Description

At present 3 projects on 2 datasets:  
  
* **Million Song Dataset**  
  * Most_Popular_Genres : Determine "Most popular music genre's in 21st century" using a very simple genre recognition (Apache Hive vs Apache Pig).  
  
* **Airline**  
  * Average_Flight_Delay_Per_Month : Compute the average	delay for all two-leg flights between an single pair of origin and destination in a given date range (Plain Map Reduce vs Apache Pig).  
  * Airline_Monthly_Delay_Pattern : Compute the pattern of monthly delays for each airline (Apache Hbase vs Secondary Sort).  
  
**Refer project specific ReadMe for details**
